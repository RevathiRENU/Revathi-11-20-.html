    <p>promotion and tenure, release time, course load, course updating, publishing,<br>
        faculty mentoring, and consistency across departments (U.S. Department of<br>
        Education, 1999).</p>
    <p><i>Inadequate Infrastructure and Technical Support</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many institutions there is limited technological infrastructure to<br>
        support distance education (U.S. Department of Education, 1997). Commu-<br>nication systems can be unreliable (Hall, J., 1995) and equipment failures<br>
        numerous. In addition, ongoing technical support for students and faculty is<br>
        lacking or insufficient at many institutions.</p>
    <p><i>Technology Limitations</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vagaries of the Internet, such as dropped connections, network conges-<br>tion, and software incompatibilities, are an issue. In addition, current band-<br>width in most homes is limited to 56K; therefore, interactive video may be too<br>
        choppy and distorted for student use. Performance limitations of the Internet<br>
        inhibit the full use of rich multimedia content and communications.</p>
    <p><i>Equity of Access For Students</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance education requires that students have access to technology. The,<br>
        cost of equipment and access charges are issues for lower-income students.</p>
    <p><i>Inadequate Reflection, Conversation and Intellectual Dialogue</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance learning might be inadequate for deliberation and discourse<br>
        among students, their instructors, and their peers. Distance education limits<br>
        the extent to which students can reflectively browse in their subject matter<br>
        with their peers and engage in exploratory discussion of their discipline<br>
        (Curran, 1997). There is value in being at a university campus interacting<br>
        socially and intellectually with fellow students and teachers (Plant, 1996).</p>
    <p><i>Maintaining Sufficient Student Contact</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fundamental problem with distance education is how to maintain<br>
        sufficient student contact, including timely assistance and adequate per-<br>formance feedback (Hall, J., 1995). The Further Education Funding Council, in<br>
        visits to 50 colleges during the year 2000, and in surveys of 1,400 distance<br>
        learning students, found inadequate guidance and support, leading to “unac-<br>ceptably low” achievement rates. The report stated that most colleges do not<br>
        take the initiative to keep in contact with students (Tysome, 2001).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, recent research also indicates that through email and<br>
        chatrooms, faculty are establishing better contact with students than through<br>
        a traditional classroom environment.</p><hr><hr>


    <p><i>Possible Fraud in Authenticating Submissions</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always the problem of authentication (Hall, P., 1996). How do<br>
        we verify that persons sending assignments and tests are who they say they<br>
        are? Distance education offers a unique venue for academic dishonesty and<br>
        requires a software infrastructure to support authentication.</p>
    <p><i>Legal Issues of Intellectual Property Rights</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, teachers have been considered the owners of lectures and<br>
        course materials. The market potential of online education has led numerous<br>
        schools to attempt to claim these rights, prompting protest from faculty<br>
        organizations (Press, Washburn & Broden, 2001). In addition, syllabi or<br>
        course outlines on the Web might be absorbed into the public domain and<br>
        could be used and adapted by others (Gallick, 1998). Ownership of intellec-<br>tual property is a source of debate.</p>
    <p><i>Inadequate Financial Aid Policies</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are restrictions on financial aid availability for distance learners<br>
        (Selingo, 1998). The “50% rule” prohibits the granting of federal aid to<br>
        students who are not in a classroom seat at least 50% of their academic<br>
        program. This class-time requirement has effectively barred online colleges<br>
        from arranging federally backed financial aid for enrolled students.</p>
    <p><i>Global Issues</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at distance education from a global perspective, trans-<br>lation remains an issue. In addition, because of differences in culture, the<br>
        content of the educational materials, the values implicit in the materials,<br>
        and the underlying assumptions about educational processes need to be<br>
        reviewed and might need to be transformed (Hall, P., 1996). Underdevel-<br>oped countries might not even have access to technology. In a keynote<br>
        address concerning global distance education to officials from 30 nations,<br>
        Jacques Hallak, assistant director general for education of UNESCO,<br>
        states, “There are political concerns about sovereignty and control, impor-<br>tant differences in education policy and regulatory environments and in<br>
        the ways education institutions are chartered and governed, as well as the<br>
        realities of language, culture, and geographic perspective” (Young, 2000,<br>
        September 29, p. A46).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a dynamic time for post-secondary education institutions facing the<br>
        opportunities and challenges brought by technological innovation. There is<br>
        no question that the use of technology has advantages and disadvantages for<br>
        both users and providers of distance education.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px; padding-left: 4%;"><b>THE PLAYERS IN DISTANCE EDUCATION</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance education in the United States is offered by individual institu-<br>tions as well as a range of new, some may say “unconventional” providers of<br>
        education. According to the U.S. Department of Education (1999), other<br>
        providers include:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consortia or collaboratives that represent cooperative pooling and<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sharing arrangements among institutions (typically, traditional col-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leges and universities). In these arrangements, multiple institutions<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;join together to provide distance education on a statewide or regional<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basis. The authority to award degrees and credits, however, remains<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with each member institution and does not shift to the consortium….<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracted or brokered arrangements that are configurations of<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;institutions, faculty, or other providers brought together solely for<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the purpose of delivering distance education. In contrast to consortia<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or collaboratives, the authority to award degrees and credits rests<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the contracting or organizing entity, not with the originating<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;institution….<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual universities, or institutions that offer most or all of their<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruction via technological means and are distinguished by their<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nearly exclusive use of technology as the educational delivery<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;device. (p. 6)</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sampling of the various types of players in distance education in higher<br>
        education follows.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many states have active distance education programs. For example, the<br>
        Education Network of Maine is an independent arm of the Maine university<br>
        system. Colorado established the Colorado Electronic Community College as<br>
        the state’s 12th community college (The Chronicle of Higher Education, 1995,<br>
        December 8, as cited in U.S. Department of Education, 1997). Among the<br>
        other notable education systems are EdNet in Oregon, the Iowa Communica-<br>tions Network, the TeleLinking Network in Kentucky, and BadgerNet in<br>
        Wisconsin (U.S. Department of Education, 1997).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California State University (CSU) is one of the leading practitioners in<bR>
        distance education (Primary Research Group, 1997). CSU is the largest<br>
        system of state colleges in the country, with 23 campuses and 255,500 full-<br>time students. CSU embraces the digital revolution, including the virtual<br>
        classroom and online applications. To finance educational technology, CSU<br>
        is proposing the California Educational Technology Initiative—a 10-year, $4<br>
        billion revenue partnership with four private corporations: Microsoft Corpo-<br>ration, Hughes Electronics Corporation, GTE Corporation, and Fujitsu Ltd.<br>
        (Gallick, 1998). This initiative will have a major impact on distance education<br>
        at CSU.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universities, such as Columbia, Cornell, Duke, NYU, Temple, Mary-<br>land, and Nebraska, have all established “for-profit” subsidiaries to market<br>
        distance education programs. Many more schools are collaborating with<br>
        commercial and nontraditional providers. For instance, Columbia Business<br>
        School, the University of Chicago, Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon<br>
        University, and the London School of Economics and Political Science have<br>
        agreed to develop content for Cardean University, a virtual school for<br>
        business education (a division of UNext) launched by Oracle CEO Lawrence<br>
        Ellison and former junk-bond magnate Michael Milken (Terry, 2000).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other states and institutions have joined together in cooperatives and<br>
        consortia to support and offer distance education. The Committee on Institu-<br>tional Cooperation is an example of such a cooperative. It consists of 12 large<br>
        institutions including Pennsylvania State University, the University of Iowa,<br>
        Ohio State University, the University of Minnesota, the University of Wis-<br>consin, and the University of Illinois (The Chronicle of Higher Education,<br>
        1995, December 8, as cited in U.S. Department of Education, 1997).</p>
    <p class="a">As more colleges consider collaborations as a way to move quickly<br>
        into distance education, two notable models are Western Governors<br>
        University and the Southern Regional Education Board’s Elec-<br>tronic Campus. Both span huge geographic regions, but their<br>
        approaches and records diverge (Carnevale, 2000, May 19, p. A53).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the west, 13 members of the Western Governors Association created<br>
        Western Governors University (WGU), a degree-granting virtual university<br>
        (Ashworth, 1996). WGU has administrative headquarters in Salt Lake City,<br>
        Utah, and academic headquarters in Colorado (Gallick, 1998). The university<br>
        was founded in 1997 and began enrolling students in September, 1998. This<br>
        virtual university has no campus and relies on computers and other technol-<br>ogy, such as interactive video, to deliver instruction (U.S. Department of<br>
        Education, 1997). Students can gain knowledge in courses offered by 40<br>
        colleges and universities in 22 states and Guam. WGU brings together, under<br>
        a single academic banner, courses created at a variety of member institutions,<br>
        and awards degrees under its own name. WGU promises to revolutionize<br>
        higher education by offering degrees—based on a new, competency-based<br>
        testing system—that will compete with those offered by existing colleges.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, WGU found, as have other players, that entering into<br>
        the distance education environment can be arduous. “WGU…has failed to<br>
        meet any of its enrollment targets, is running a deficit, and lacks accreditation”<br>
        (Carnevale, 2000, May 19, p. A53). Today, WGU enrolls 200 degree-seeking<br>
        students. When first conceived, WGU anticipated 500 degree-seeking stu-<br>dents by the year 2000 (Carnevale, 2000, May 19; Carr, 2001). Utah’s auditor</p>
    <hr><hr>
    
        <p>general released an audit of WGU, criticizing it for low enrollment and poor<br>
        performance in competing with other distance education programs (Carnevale,<br>
        2000, October 6). WGU also found that gaining accreditation is a slow<br>
        process. After two years, in November, 2000, WGU was awarded candidate<br>
        status in the accreditation process. WGU expects to gain accreditation after<br>
        further evaluation, which typically takes an additional two to five years. In<br>
        WGU’s favor, other virtual universities, such as Jones International Univer-<br>sity and Regents College, have already gained accreditation. In addition,<br>
        Regents, like WGU, also awards degrees through competency-based assess-<br>ments (Carnevale, 2000, December 15).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southern Regional Electronic Campus is a consortium of 16 south-<br>ern states. It is made up of more than 262 colleges and universities that enroll<br>
        20,000 students in distance education courses. The Electronic Campus lists<br>
        more than 3,200 courses (it began with 40 in 1998), and 102 degree programs<br>
        (Carnevale, 2000, May 19). The Electronic Campus is a loose collective that<br>
        started out providing members little more than a common Web site to<br>
        publicize online offerings. Students earn course credits and degrees from the<br>
        individual participating institutions. The Electronic Campus has a policy of<br>
        not setting strict rules for its member institutions. It is essentially a free-trade<br>
        zone where states can develop their own online course material and then share<br>
        it with other states. Its purpose is to share resources and help market the<br>
        courses that its institutions create.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to WGU, the Southern Regional Electronic Campus “hasn’t<br>
        attempted to reshape academe or to compete with anyone, but rather, to give<br>
        students easy access to online courses offered by participating colleges”<br>
        (Carnevale, 2000, May 19, p. A53). Many new collaborations are being<br>
        modeled after the Southern Regional Electronic Campus rather than WGU.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials of WGU announced in November, 1998, that they were estab-<br>lishing a distance education consortium with Britain’s well-known Open<br>
        University. The new organization, called the Governors Open University<br>
        System, serves as a front end for the two universities, and students enrolled<br>
        in either institution are able to take courses through the other (McCollum,<br>
        1998). In 1999, Britain’s Open University opened a new sister institution in<br>
        America—the United States Open University.</p>
    <p>In higher education, the highest-profile virtual college is the University<br>
        of Phoenix, which has a complete curriculum and a sophisticated delivery<br>
        system (O’Leary, 2000). Started in 1989, the University of Phoenix is the<br>
        largest private school in the U.S., enrolling more than 75,000 students; 13,800<br>
        students from 25 countries take online courses. In September, 1999, the<br>
        Apollo Group, parent company of the University of Phoenix, raised $70</p><hr><hr>



    <p>million from investors on Wall Street in a stock offering tied directly to the<br>
        distance education unit. It is the first test of a public offering of stock in a<br>
        distance learning institution. Table 1 lists a few virtual universities.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors are pouring millions into Web education. So far the biggest<br>
        player is Michael Milken, his brother Lowell, and Oracle’s Larry Ellison.<br>
        They own Knowledge Universe, a venture hatchery for education and<br>
        training companies. The Washington Post Company is also knee-deep in<br>
        edu-ventures, including the ownership of Kaplan College. Wall Street<br>
        magnate Herbert Allen of Allen & Co. has earmarked $20 million to<br>
        launch and sustain Global Education Network, a clearinghouse of courses<br>
        from America’s top colleges, including Brown, Wellesley, and Williams.<br>
        (Svetcov, 2000). In 2000, billionaire Michael Saylor donated $100 mil-<br>lion toward the creation of an online university that will offer an “Ivy<br>
        League” level of education free of charge.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technologies for an advanced Internet are now being actively studied for<br>
        use in higher education by a three-way partnership that includes government,<br>
        industry, and academia (Houweling, 2000). The “Internet2” project focuses<br>
        on new technologies and applications and on the convergence, or the unified<br>
        delivery of services such as text, voice, video, and data. Since it began in<br>
        October, 1996, the Internet2 project has grown to include over 150 universi-<br>ties, more than 50 companies, and dozens of other organizations focused on<br>
        advanced networking (Houweling, 2000).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As distance learning becomes a serious alternative to the standard<br>
        classroom environment, enormous opportunities and dilemmas present them-<br>selves for the players in distance education. Software developers, telecommu-<br>nications companies, hardware makers, publishers, Internet and Web service<br>
        providers, and many other technology- and education-based services are<br>
        developing systems for this emerging market that capitalize on the special<br>
        capabilities of different technologies.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 16px; padding-left: 20%;"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbThe ever-accelerating growth in information technology and the prolif-<br>eration of distance education are exciting developments in higher education<br>
        that could bring about some of the most profound changes to the ways we<br>
        teach and learn. They provide extraordinary opportunities to transform the<br>
        when, where, and how of what we teach (Matthews, 1999). Taking a class and<br>
        ultimately receiving a college degree are being added to the list of stay-at-<br>home electronic activities.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educators have the opportunity to define, design, and manage effective<br>
        and robust teaching and learning systems, programs, and courses. It is no<br>
        longer a question of whether or not the new higher education will develop, but<br>
        how fast it will occur (Connick, 1997). Adopting new approaches to education<br>
        is not an option—it is imperative. No generation will have the opportunity that<br>
        we have to put a mark on the look of education in the future. Technology has<br>
        penetrated all aspects of education and will change it dramatically.</p>
